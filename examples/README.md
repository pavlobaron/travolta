Travolta examples:

Examples work with the Disco master on the localhost (default port).

books.py - call it as "python books.py". Will parse data/books.xml and emit every book title

wikiextract.py - call as "python wikidump.py". Will transform data/wikidump.xml into flat text, one wiki article after another. Also works with the full dump - examples uses a small subset of it
