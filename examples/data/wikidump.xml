Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&quot; [[Emma Goldman]]. &quot;What it Really Stands for Anarchy&quot; in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both.... Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of 'emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual'.... You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a 'method of individualization'.

I am a Communist because I am an Individualist.

Anarchism as a mass [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]], with [[individualist anarchism]] being primarily a literary phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Skirda|Skirda, Alexandre]].

AK Press, 2002, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents&lt;ref&gt;Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of [[anarcho-communist]] groups and by members of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as [[Federico Urales]] and [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] who were members of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]]. Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923-1938.'' ISBN 978-84-96044-87-6&lt;/ref&gt; and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Within the [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesist]] anarchist organization, the [[Fédération Anarchiste]], there existed an individualist anarchist tendency alongside anarcho-communist and anarchosyndicalist currents.

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}
The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] ἄναρχος, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy].

There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word &quot;anarchist&quot; or &quot;anarchism&quot; in describing themselves or their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anarchists |last=Joll |first=James |year=1964 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-03642-5 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, making the formal birth of anarchism the mid-nineteenth century.

===Origins===

The French [[Renaissance humanism|renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] has been said to write an important anarchist precedent in his most famous work the ''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude''.&lt;ref&gt;Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie´s treatise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se. But while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=6o-8P3iqf7IC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=anarchism+la+boetie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z79GU1rW1t&amp;sig=4ini7oZUie2U8-P0BpMLogXYWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eAOFUJCYJ4Le9AT_iYG4DA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anarchism%20la%20boetie&amp;f=false ''Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' by Murray Rothbard. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. pg. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quite rightly, La Boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader, elected by the people, becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny. Indeed, we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission.&quot;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/saul-newman-voluntary-servitude-reconsidered-radical-politics-and-the-problem-of-self-dominatio  [[Saul Newman]]. &quot;Voluntary Servitude Reconsidered: Radical Politics and the Problem of Self-Domination&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The radical [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant Christian]] [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and his group the [[Diggers]] are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the Diggers, or True Levellers, in seventeenth-century England led by Gerrard Winstanley as a source of pride. Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html Kenneth C.

Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''.&quot; Marlow. &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609-c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649-1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods.&quot; George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean.

===First International and the Paris Commune===

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-595-24912-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-8476-7680-3 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8101-1740-1 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] reports that &quot;The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse - that they had split away from the Fédération Romande - was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled [[Paris]] from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included {{quote|[[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised...Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;implementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848...and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html &quot;The Paris Commune&quot; by Anarcho]&lt;/ref&gt;}} George Woodcock manifests that {{quote|a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the [[Collectivist anarchism|libertarian collectivists]] Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and [[Elisée Reclus]] and Louise Michel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;}}

The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day.

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]...it grew quickly
to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed|Illegalism|Expropriative anarchism}}
[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Italian-American]] anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on 'tyrants' and 'enemies of the people']]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, 25 July 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=21 April 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s, and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ‘[[Confiscation|expropriations]]’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090312022528/http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm &quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be ''exemplary'' invitations to revolt.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The &quot;illegalists&quot; by Doug Imrie. From &quot;Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed&quot; , Fall-Winter, 1994-95]&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{Cite news|author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July -August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]]'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]].  Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after [[World War I]] (1914–1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].

===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt uprising]], before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&quot; Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-486-43270-X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutions of 1917–23|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] which established the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Munich Soviet (or “Council Republic”) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though — like most revolutions — its stated goals were not exactly “temporary.” Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B. Traven), gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor.&quot; [[Hakim Bey]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.

{{Main|Anti-fascism}}{{See also|Anarchism in France|Anarchism in Italy|Anarchism in Spain}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''.

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Frank_Fernandez__Cuban_Anarchism__The_History_of_A_Movement.html#toc8 ''Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement'' by Frank Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertgraham.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/ Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939-1977) « Robert Graham’s Anarchism Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 in [[Anarchism in France|France]] the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] was established and the also [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist]] [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] was founded in [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.&quot;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence. Its first practical manifestation was at the level of method: nonviolent direct action, principled and pragmatic, was used widely in both the Civil Rights movement in the USA and the campaign against nuclear weapons in Britain and elsewhere.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html#toc13 Geoffrey Ostergaard.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. The [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and the movement against the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] also contributed to the revival of North American anarchism. European anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement, and both have incorporated [[animal rights]] activism. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[ecology|ecological]] and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{Cite book| page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7425-2943-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; According to anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]...One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon_Critchley#Infinitely_Demanding_.282007.29|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]].

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail - Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]].

==Anarchist schools of thought==
{{Main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post-classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

(Mar., 1986), pp. 300-302.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical anarchist schools of thought===

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-691-04494-5, p.6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

Greene]] presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;againstallauthority.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.

====Social anarchism====
{{Main|Social anarchism}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with public ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens . . . the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist anarchism capitalistic? ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;&quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use.

[[AK Press]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or ''[[propaganda by the deed]]'', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=978-1-904859-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-36182-6 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labor unions]] as a potential force for [[revolution]]ary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' [[Wiktionary:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]]
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''.The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labor movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

[[Anarcha-feminism]] developed as a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education, and [[gender role]]s.

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].{{-}}

==Topics of interest==
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

===Free love===

[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|300px|French [[individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] (1872–1962), who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
An important current within anarchism is [[free love]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy |publisher=Ncc-1776.org |date=1 December 1996 |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101231195631/http://ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html| archivedate= 31 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–250.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|''The Word'']]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895-1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897-1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the [[United States]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902-1909'', p.551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot;—censorship of sexual information. Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''Der arme Teufel''. In Argentina anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' ({{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;molyneux&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via [[Robert Owen|Owen]]), emphasized - as we would expect - the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values.[http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm &quot;Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren&quot; by Crispin Sartwell]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters...who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=The False Principle of our Education|author=Max Stirner |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C.

Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''.

The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901. Russian [[christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html &quot;The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance&quot; by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W.

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that &quot;A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of “hearts not heads in the school”. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]].

In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularized by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|disorder of neural development]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] and [[communication]], and by restricted and repetitive behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{vcite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism affects information processing in the [[Human brain|brain]] by altering how nerve cells and their [[synapse]]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; It is one of three recognized disorders in the [[autism spectrum]] (ASDs), the other two being [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified]] (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare [[mutation]]s, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s or childhood [[vaccine]]s;&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt;  the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=GerberOffit2009&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Gerber JS, Offit PA |title= Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses |journal= Clin Infect Dis |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |pmc= 2908388 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prevalence]] of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) report 11 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD as of 2008.&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt;&lt;ref name=vaccines/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMWR2012&gt;{{vcite journal |author= |title=Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders - autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 14 sites, United States, 2008 |journal=MMWR Surveill Summ |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=1–19 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22456193|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people diagnosed with autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].&lt;ref name=Stefanatos/&gt; [[Early intensive behavior intervention|Early behavioral]] or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Although there is no known cure,&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; there have been reported cases of children who recovered.&lt;ref name=Helt/&gt; Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.&lt;ref name=Howlin/&gt; An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Rogers SJ |title=What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? |title.= |journal=Autism Res |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=125–37 |year=2009 |pmid=19582867 |doi=10.1002/aur.81 |pmc=2791538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see ''[[#Classification|Classification]]'') from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]] |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=0-679-43785-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others.

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [[tantrum]]s. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Interpers Violence |year=2008 |title=Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals |author=Långström N, Grann M, Ruchkin V, Sjöstedt G, Fazel S |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1358–70 |doi=10.1177/0886260508322195 |pmid=18701743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2006 |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=621–32 |title=The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |author=Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |pmid=16901289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–215 |title=Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |author=Johnson CP, Myers SM, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=Landa&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |title=Early communication development and intervention for children with autism |author=Landa R |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134 |pmid=17326115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |title=Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author=Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt; categorizes as follows.

On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in row]]
* '''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* '''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
* '''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* '''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=855–66 |title=The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders |author=Lam KSL, Aman MG |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z |pmid=17048092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* '''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking, [[skin picking]], hand biting, and head banging.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt;
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2000 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |title=Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation |author=Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855 |pmid=11055459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator.

==Classification==
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A |title=Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=1–2 |pages=108–15 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x |pmid=19220594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Freitag CM |title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[mentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F |title=Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure |journal=Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=540–7 |year=1999 |url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=[[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen S]] |title=The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism |journal=Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry |year=2006 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=865–72 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010 |pmid=16519981 |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;!-- ref name=Penn/ --&gt; How autism occurs is not well understood.

From studies based on [[event-related potential]]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jeste SS, Nelson CA 3rd |title=Event related potentials in the understanding of autism spectrum disorders: an analytical review |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=495–510 |year=2009 |pmid=18850262 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0652-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[magnetoencephalography]] studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Roberts TP, Schmidt GL, Egeth M ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Electrophysiological signatures: magnetoencephalographic studies of the neural correlates of language impairment in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Int J Psychophysiol |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=149–60 |year=2008 |pmid=18336941 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.012 |pmc=2397446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and [[schizophrenia]] based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with [[1q21.1 deletion syndrome]].

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing;&lt;ref name=E-S-theory/&gt; this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Spelke ES |title=Sex differences in intrinsic aptitude for mathematics and science?: a critical review |journal=Am Psychol |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=950–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16366817 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.60.9.950 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/spelke2005.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are somewhat related to the earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=E-S-theory&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S |title=Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1156 |pages=68–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19338503 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hamilton AFdC |title=Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=881–92 |year=2009 |pmid=19508497 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]]. In his review, Kenworthy states that &quot;the claim of [[executive dysfunction]] as a causal factor in autism is controversial&quot;, however, &quot;it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B |title=Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism |journal=Dev Psychopathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1103–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18838033 |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hill EL |title=Executive dysfunction in autism |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 |pmid=14697400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL |title=Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=320–38 |year=2008 |pmid=18956239 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7 |pmc=2856078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt;

[[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F, Frith U |title=The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–25 |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 |pmid=16450045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=27–43 |title=Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception |author=Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 |pmid=16453071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=HappeTime&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F, Ronald A, [[Robert Plomin|Plomin R]] |title=Time to give up on a single explanation for autism |journal=Nat Neurosci |year=2006 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=1218–20 |doi=10.1038/nn1770 |pmid=17001340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Dev Rev |year=2007 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=224–60 |title=Cognitive theories of autism |author=Rajendran G, Mitchell P |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; According to an article in the ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'', failure to meet any of the following milestones &quot;is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome&quot;.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt;
* No [[babbling]] by 12 months.
* No [[Gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months.
* No single words by 16 months.
* No two-word (spontaneous, not just [[echolalia|echolalic]]) phrases by 24 months.
* Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.
US and Japanese practice is to [[Screening (medicine)|screen]] all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] (many false-negatives) but good [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] (few false-positives).&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Wetherby AM, Brosnan-Maddox S, Peace V, Newton L |title=Validation of the Infant–Toddler Checklist as a broadband screener for autism spectrum disorders from 9 to 24 months of age |journal=Autism |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=487–511 |year=2008 |pmid=18805944 |doi=10.1177/1362361308094501 |pmc=2663025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Acta Paediatr |year=2008 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=539–40 |title=The challenge of screening for autism spectrum disorder in a culturally diverse society |author=Wallis KE, Pinto-Martin J |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00720.x |pmid=18373717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[genetic screening]] for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and [[dysmorphic feature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Lintas C, Persico AM |title=Autistic phenotypes and genetic testing: state-of-the-art for the clinical geneticist |journal=J Med Genet |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2009 |pmid=18728070 |pmc=2603481 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2008.060871 |url=http://jmg.bmj.com/content/46/1/1.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry and psychology|idiosyncratic language]], and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]] or [[childhood disintegrative disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f84 |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-10-10 |work=ICD-10: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision |publisher=World Health Organization |title=F84. Pervasive developmental disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Gotham K, Risi S, Dawson G, ''et al.'' |title=A replication of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) revised algorithms |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=642–51 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18434924 |pmc=3057666 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816bffb7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=Kanne&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE |title=Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=367–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18855144 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[mental retardation]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=349–53 |title=Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |title.= |author=Mantovani JF |doi=10.1017/S0012162200210621 |pmid=10855658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Mood disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Matson JL, Neal D |title=Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions |journal=Psychiatr Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |year=2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Genet Med |year=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title=Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author=Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laysource=Medical News Today |laydate=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[genotype]]-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Ledbetter DH |title=Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=16 |pages=1728–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18784093 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0806570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet |year=2006 |volume=142C |issue=1 |pages=52–7 |title=Genetic counseling and ethical issues for autism |author=McMahon WM, Baty BJ, Botkin J |doi=10.1002/ajmg.c.30082 |pmid=16419100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metabolic]] and [[neuroimaging]] tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt;

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Landa3&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Nat Clin Pract Neurol |year=2008 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=138–47 |title=Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |author=Landa RJ |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0731 |pmid=18253102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |year=2007 |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |title=How to diagnose autism |author=Dover CJ, Le Couteur A |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280 |pmid=17515625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Shattuck PT, Durkin M, Maenner M ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Timing of identification among children with an autism spectrum disorder: findings from a population-based surveillance study |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=474–83 |year=2009 |pmid=19318992 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31819b3848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |publisher=National Autistic Society |title=Diagnosis: how can it benefit me as an adult? |title.= |year=2005 |url=http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/all-about-diagnosis/diagnosis-the-process-for-adults/diagnosis-how-can-it-benefit-me-as-an-adult.aspx |accessdate=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD |title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=129–35 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143 |pmid=17563895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research |author=Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–38 |doi=10.1177/1362361398022002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter= Learning in autism |author= Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title= Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor= Byrne JH (ed.-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol. ed.) |publisher= Academic Press |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=0-12-370504-5 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For PDD-NOS the association with mental retardation is much weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E |title= Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children |journal=JAMA |year=2001 |volume=285 |issue=24 |pages=3093–9 |pmid=11427137 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 |doi= 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L |title=Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=216–29 |year=2009 |pmid=19223098 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003 |pmc=2692135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of [[language disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatr Res |year=2009 |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=599–606 |title=The role of epilepsy and epileptiform EEGs in autism spectrum disorders |author=Spence SJ, Schneider MT |doi=10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7168 |pmid=19454962 |pmc=2692092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=Manzi&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Child Neurol |year=2008 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=307–14 |title=Autism and metabolic diseases |author=Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P |doi=10.1177/0883073807308698 |pmid=18079313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder| Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Eur J Pediatr |year=2008 |title=What's new in autism? |title.= |author=Steyaert JG, De La Marche W |doi=10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 |pmid=18597114 |volume=167 |issue=10 |pages=1091–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Richdale AL, Schreck KA |title=Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=403–11 |year=2009 |pmid=19398354 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality |author=[[Lorna Wing|Wing L]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |author=Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |title.= |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Houston R, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0-631-22089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=201–8 |title=The history of autism |author=Wolff S |doi=10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5 |pmid=15365889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kuhn R; tr. Cahn CH |title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology |journal=Hist Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=361–6 |doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603 |pmid=15386868 }} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 |trans_title=The psychically abnormal child |author=[[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]] |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=Kanner1943&gt;{{vcite journal |author=[[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]] |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 }} Reprinted in {{vcite journal |year=1968 |journal=Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460 |author=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot. --&gt; |title=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot. --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2022–3 |title=Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 |pmid=17922179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Can J Psychiatry |year=2003 |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=503–5 |title=Modern views of autism |author=Fombonne E |pmid=14574825 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author=[[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-54957-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title=Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism |author=Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 |pmid=18297387 |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1320–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=323–30 |title=A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting |author=Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x |pmid=16119473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet]] has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Biever C |title=Web removes social barriers for those with autism |journal=New Sci |issue=2610 |pages=26–7 |date=2007 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.&lt;ref name=Silverman&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Biosocieties |year=2008 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=325–41 |title=Fieldwork on another planet: social science perspectives on the autism spectrum |author=Silverman C |doi=10.1017/S1745855208006236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |author=Harmon A |title=How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=2004-12-20 |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Terrestrial albedo */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Albedo2012hessel herring skin updated.png|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot; (or reflected sunlight), in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.  Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]], as well as in calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings, computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''Photometria''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature [[feedback]]. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is also true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;).

The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If the Earth was frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot;/&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if all the ice on Earth were to melt—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt; 

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless solar system bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the [[opposition effect]] of [[regolith]] surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometres, and ''H'' is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Although the albedo-temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater.  The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between 3 and 12 degrees north.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99(11) |pages=818–827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt;

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees===
Since forests are generally attributed a low albedo, (as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo. Through the [[evapotranspiration]] of water, trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy. This water vapour rises resulting in [[cloud cover]] which also has a high albedo, thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests.

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland - Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed July 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-01-24 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;uww&quot; /&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JGR....9714565C |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date=1991-05-30 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change [[cloud]] properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

{{Two other uses|the Latin letter|the English indefinite article|a and an}}

'''A''' ([[English_alphabet#Letter_names|named]] ''a'' {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}, plural ''aes''&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;) is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and [[vowel]] in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter [[Alpha]], from which it derives.

== Origins ==
The earliest certain ancestor of &quot;A&quot; is [[aleph]] (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; (which, by consisting entirely of [[consonant]]s, is an [[abjad]] rather than a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s.

|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

In 1600 B.C., the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] [[aleph]].

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]]—the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]]—so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and gave it the similar name of [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-story '''a''' and single-story '''ɑ'''.]]
The letter has two [[lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current [[handwriting]] consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|&quot;ɑ&quot;}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|&quot;a&quot;}}). Both derive from the [[majuscule]] (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Use in English==
{{main|a (disambiguation)}}
In [[English language|English]], the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad''; the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) {{citation needed span|text=as in ''father'', its original, Latin and Greek, sound|date=November 2012}}; a closer, further fronted sound as in &quot;hare&quot;, which developed as the sound progressed from &quot;father&quot; to &quot;ace&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[great vowel shift]]; the more rounded form in &quot;water&quot; or its closely related cousin, found in &quot;was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is the third most commonly used letter in English, and the second most common in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be ⟨a⟩, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity College&quot; /&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; A grade for clean restaurants; [[A-List]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20100903-20689.html |title=Letters affect exam results |date=9 March 2010 |publisher=British Psychological Society |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in other languages==
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel: {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich language|Saanich]], in which A (and [[Á]]) stand for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}. In the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of A denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital A denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase a denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].
